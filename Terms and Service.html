                    <p>11. <strong>Limited License to Access Content.</strong> The Content appearing on Spayce may be subject to copyright protection. Applicable copyrights are the proprietary property of Spayce, its Users, its licensors, or other third parties with all rights reserved.</p>
                    <p>a. Content on Spayce may not be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, distributed, or otherwise used for the creation of derivative works without the express written consent of Spayce.</p>
                    <p>b. Users are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited permission to access and display the Content appearing on Spayce on the User's client for purposes of personal, non-commercial use of the Service subject to these Terms. Users must retain all copyright, trademarks, and other intellectual property notices contained in content.</p>
                    <p>c. Some Content appearing on Spayce, including, but not limited to, third party content, software and related resources, may be subject to their own terms, conditions, licenses and notices. Such Content shall be governed by their own terms and conditions as may or may not be provided.</p>
                    <p>d. All licenses provided to Users by Spayce are subject to revocation by the Service at any time without notice and with or without cause.

                    <p>12. <strong>Trademarks, Service Marks and Other Intellectual Property.</strong> Content appearing on Spayce may contain trademarks, service marks, trade names and trade dress owned by Spayce. These marks and names are subject to applicable trademark laws in the United States and internationally, and may not be used in connection with any service or product that is likely to violate applicable trademark laws unless such use is expressly granted by Spayce. Unless explicitly stated, nothing in these Terms shall be construed as a grant of intellectual property rights under any legal theory.
</p>
                    <p>13. <strong>Third Party Content and Services.</strong> The Content available via the Service may include access to third party sites, services and content provided by other Users that is completely independent of Spayce.</p>
                    <p>a. These third party resources may include, but are not limited to, third party web sites, software, products, services, networks and similar resources.</p>
                    <p>b. Inclusion of third party resources on Spayce does not imply endorsement or approval of any particular resource. Spayce does not investigate, review, monitor or otherwise regulate third party resources that may appear on the Site, and the Service does not warrant the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness of third party resources appearing on the Site. Any User choosing to interact with a third party resource appearing on Spayce is subject to the terms and conditions of that particular third party resource.</p>
                    <p>c. Users access third party resources found on the Site at their own risk. Spayce urges Users to review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any third party resource accessed from Spayce.

                    <p>b. All links to Spayce are subject to the Site's continuing permission to maintain such links. Spayce reserves the right to terminate permission to link to the Site at any time and third parties that link to the Site are obligated to immediately remove all links to the Site upon the request of Spayce.</p>

                    <p>a. Spayce does not verify, guarantee or make any representations regarding the identity of any User.</p>

                    <p>19. <strong>Compliance with Terms.</strong> Spayce reserves the right to monitor any communications between Users for the purposes of enforcing compliance with these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>Data Provision and Battery Lifespan</h2>
                    <p>21. <strong>Data Provision and Battery Lifespan.</strong> Spayce relies on certain data to operate on a mobile device, including, but not limited to, User location information and User generated Content. By default, data used for running Spayce is automatically fetched or pushed via a data connection, without any limitation. The more frequently your mobile device pushes or fetches data, the quicker your device battery may drain. Users are advised that they may adjust location settings via their mobile device's operating system software. Spayce may also provide certain settings within the Service that limit or reduce automatic data transfer, as Spayce may determine from time to time.<br>
                    Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</p>
                    <p>22. <strong>Disclaimers.</strong> Spayce attempts to ensure accuracy of information on the Service, but cannot guarantee that any content is entirely correct, current or complete. The Site may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. The Site may occasionally be temporarily unavailable for maintenance and related reasons. USE OF THIS SITE IS AT A USER'S SOLE RISK. ALL CONTENT AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER.

WITHOUT LIMITATION, SPAYCE MAKES NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT THIS SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ACCESSING SPAYCE IS AT THE USER'S OWN RISK AND DISCRETION AND THAT THE USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA OR DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
                    <p>23. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT WILL SPAYCE OR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, THE SITE'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO THE SITE FOR THE SERVICE, BUT IN NO CASE WILL THE SITE'S LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED $100.

                    <p>25. <strong>Notices.</strong> Any notice or other communication regarding these Terms shall be written. Notices sent to Spayce shall be sent to info@spayce.me</p>
                    <p>26. <strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Site has been designed to comply with United States law.

                    <p>29. <strong>Severability.</strong> If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these Terms to be unenforceable, that provision of these Terms will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>30. <strong>Modifications.</strong> Spayce retains the right to modify these Terms at any time, and changes shall become effective immediately upon publication. While Spayce may notify Users of changes, the User is obligated to review these Terms on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p>31. <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, including additional policies incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between Spayce and a User.</p>
                    <p>32. <strong>Waiver.</strong> Spayce's failure to act with respect to a breach of these terms by a User does not waive the Site's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
